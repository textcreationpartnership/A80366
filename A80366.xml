            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>FRancis</hi> Earl of <hi>Carlingford</hi> is ſeized of a ſmall Eſtate in <hi>Ireland</hi> which is not forfeited, but is charged with Debts and Incumbrances to near the value thereof, and among others, there are claimed as due upon the ſaid Eſtate ſome dormant Debts to Forfeiting Perſons, which Forfeited Debts by the Bill now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending will be veſted in the Truſtees.</p>
            <p>There is a Stated Debt of 4000 <hi>l.</hi> due from the Crown to my Lord <hi>Carlingford;</hi> as alſo the King, ſince the War ended, directed <hi>Ballimote,</hi> the Chief Seat of his Family of conſiderable Value, to be Demoliſhed, for the Safety of that Country; and in the late War, and on all Occaſions in the ſeveral Stations he hath been in Abroad, he hath moſt Zealouſly and Faithfully and to good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect performed all the Services in his Power, not only to His Majeſty, but for the Publick Good of <hi>England;</hi> of which His Majeſty was ſo well Apprized, that he was Graciouſly diſpoſed to Diſcharge the ſaid dormant For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited Debts, but the ſame was not actually done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore, on the ſaid Conſiderations, he Humbly propoſeth a Clauſe, to Impower the Truſtees to enquire into the Truth of the ſaid Debt due to him from the Crown, and Damages by demoliſhing his Seat, and doth not propoſe any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from any other Forfeiture or Eſtate, but only that they may diſcount to him what they ſhall think fit out of the Debts claimed as Forfeited, and pretended due upon his own Eſtate, and doth not expect otherwiſe ever to be Satisfied or Repaired.</hi>
